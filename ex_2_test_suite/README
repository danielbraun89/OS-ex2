-- OS 2017 - ex2 test suite --
by Jona Harris


Run the tests:
- Put your uthreads library (libuthreads.a) in the same directory with the suite files.
- execute 'compile_all' to compile the tests.
- execute 'run_all' to run the tests sequentially. 


Notes:
- uthreads functions are not called with invalid input, so the library should not yield any error during the tests.
- Each test has a brief description inside it.
- Tests' output is colored so it is easily distinguished from the uthreads library output, if exist.

Here's a little song


Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

(fun fact: the first song to be sung by computer. youtu.be/41U78QP8nBk )
